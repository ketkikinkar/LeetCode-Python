5. Longest Palindromic Substring https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.

    """Time Complexity: O(n²)

The outer loop iterates through each character of the string, which is O(n)
For each character, there are two inner while loops (for odd and even length palindromes)
Each inner while loop can potentially expand to check the entire string, which is O(n)
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(n)

The res variable stores a substring of the input string, which in the worst case could be the entire string
This requires O(n) space
All other variables use constant space"""
