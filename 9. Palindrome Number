Hint
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x<0 or (x%10==0 and x!=0):
            return False
        revertedNum = 0
        n = x
        while revertedNum < n:
            revertedNum = revertedNum * 10 + x%10
            print(revertedNum)
            x//=10
        return n==revertedNum
