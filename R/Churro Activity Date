Find the inspection date and risk category (pe_description) of facilities named 'STREET CHURROS' that received a score below 95.

Table: los_angeles_restaurant_health_inspections
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
To find the activity date and pe_description of facilities with the name 'STREET CHURROS' and with a score of less than 95 points, we can use the dplyr package in R.

Hint #2
Keep going! In the first step, we need to filter the dataset to only include rows where the facility_name is "STREET CHURROS" and the score is less than 95. We can use the filter() function from dplyr to do this.


filter(facility_name == "STREET CHURROS" & score < 95)
Hint #3
Well done! In the final step, we need to select only the activity_date and pe_description columns from the filtered dataset. We can use the select() function from dplyr to do this.


select(activity_date, pe_description)
The complete code snippet is:


library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

result <- los_angeles_restaurant_health_inspections %>%
    filter(facility_name == "STREET CHURROS" & score < 95) %>%
    select(activity_date, pe_description) %>%
    mutate(activity_date = strftime(as.Date(activity_date), format = "%Y-%m-%d"))
