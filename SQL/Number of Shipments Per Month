Table: amazon_shipment
Hints
Expected Output
Hint #1
The problem is asking to calculate the number of shipments per month. The unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id and sub_id. We need to output the year_month in format YYYY-MM and the number of shipments in that month.

Hint #2
Keep going!

We need to use the COUNT function to calculate the number of shipments. We also need to use the DATE_FORMAT function to format the shipment_date to 'YYYY-MM'. The GROUP BY clause is used to group the result-set by one or more columns, in this case, by the formatted date.

Corresponding code block:

select count(shipment_id), DATE_FORMAT(shipment_date, '%Y-%m')  date_ym
from amazon_shipment
group by date_ym;
Hint #3
Great job!

However, the unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id and sub_id. So, we need to count the combination of shipment_id and sub_id instead of just shipment_id. We can achieve this by concatenating shipment_id and sub_id and then count the result.

Entire code:

select count(concat(shipment_id, sub_id)), DATE_FORMAT(shipment_date, '%Y-%m')  date_ym
from amazon_shipment
group by date_ym;
