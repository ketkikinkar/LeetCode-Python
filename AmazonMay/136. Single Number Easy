Hint
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

# SOLTUION

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # if two XOR two same number its gonna cancel out
        # XOR can be done in any 
        # n ^ 0 = n so zero is good default value
        res = 0
        for n in nums:
            res = n ^ res
        return res
