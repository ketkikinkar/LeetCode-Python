Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true

Explanation:

The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: false

Explanation:

All elements are distinct.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]

Output: true
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashset = set()
        for n in nums:
            if n in hashset:

        """
        Time Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm iterates through each element in the input array once.
For each element, there are two operations:

Checking if the element exists in the hashset, which is O(1) on average
Adding the element to the hashset, which is also O(1) on average


Since these constant-time operations are performed n times, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(n)

In the worst case (when there are no duplicates), the hashset will store all n elements from the input array.
This results in O(n) space complexity."""
